This program allows you to host a server and have clients connect to it and voice chat

To begin:
1) Download the program
2) Ensure all dependencies installed (requirements.txt)
3) Download server.py to desired host machine and run it
4) Run launcher.py on client
5) Enter IP address of server to join
6) Chat!

Server:
- Can be hosted over local network or port forwarded to support users outside of local network joining.
- Ports 8888 should be open for TCP Inbound/Outbound, Ports 9999 should be open for UCP Inbound/Outbound

Common issues:
- Problem: I can not hear anyone when connected
- Solution: Ensure firewall and port forwarding on host machine and clients is all correct.
